# android_native

A new flutter plugin project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Common Issue

- on some device or probably some custom rom, i can't enable accessibilty service for 3rd party app cuz it doesn't show up in accessibility service setting.
Some workaround is to root the device or give WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission through adb.
